Instructions : -

1) Download/Clone the repository on the local file system.

2) Make sure you keep all the files in one folder when you run them. This ensures that all the intermediate pickle files which will be generated/read-in are done so without any path errors.

3) Run each file in order by typing python “file_name”.py

4) The above has been tested on various machines apart from my own.
